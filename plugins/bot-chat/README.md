# bot-chat plugin

Bind a Claude Code session to an IM chat room: push long-task results to the room, and receive room messages into the session (via a local channel bridge).

## How to use

### 1. Install the plugin

Add the AgentX marketplace (once) and install:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add agentx-team/claude-plugins
claude plugin install bot-chat@agentx-plugins
```

### 2. Get your credentials from AgentX and export them

Three values are needed (all from the AgentX web console):

1. **`BOT_ID`** — open **Settings → Bots** (`/settings/bots`). If you don't
   have a bot yet, click **Add Bot** and connect one (Matrix and WeChat are
   recommended; WeChat binds via QR scan). Each bot row shows its public id
   (`axb_…`) next to the status dot — click it to copy.
2. **`BOT_API_KEY`** — open **Settings → API Keys** (`/settings/api-keys`)
   and create a key (`agx_…`). The plaintext is shown **once**; copy it.
   The key must belong to the same organization as the bot (for a personal
   bot: any key you create in your Personal org).
3. **`BOT_TARGET_USER_ID`** — who the bot should pull into the room on bind:
   - Matrix: your Matrix user id, e.g. `@you:matrix.example.com`
   - WeChat: the bound WeChat user id (`wx_user_id` in the bot's config)

Add them to your `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` (or your shell profile of choice):

```bash
export BOT_ID="axb_…"                          # from /settings/bots
export BOT_API_KEY="agx_…"                     # from /settings/api-keys
export BOT_TARGET_USER_ID="@you:matrix.example.com"
# optional:
# export BOT_ORG_ID="…"          # org scope; empty = the bot's own org
# export BOT_REQUIRE_MENTION=false  # group rooms: queue ALL messages, not just @mentions
```

Open a new terminal (or `source ~/.bashrc`) so Claude Code sessions inherit them.

### 3. Start Claude Code with the inbound channel enabled

Room replies reach the session through a **channel** (research preview), so
start Claude Code with:

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:bot-channel
```

The id after `server:` is the MCP server name declared in the plugin's
`.mcp.json` (`mcpServers` key) — for this plugin it is `bot-channel`. Without
this flag the plugin is outbound-only: results are still pushed to the room,
but room replies are not injected back into the session.

### 4. Bind a room and go

In the session:

```
/bot-chat:bot my-task-room     # create the room + invite you, bind this session
/bot-chat:bot status           # check the binding
/bot-chat:bot unbind           # unbind and leave the room
```

From then on, every completed turn's final answer is pushed to the room
automatically (Stop hook, zero model tokens). Reply in the room to talk back;
type `/clear` in the room to drop the pending message queue.

## Configuration reference

The plugin ships its own `.mcp.json` (the local `bot-channel` bridge only). **No json edits after install** — everything is environment variables. Bot identity/config travels in the `X-Config` header, invisible to MCP tool semantics (the body carries only `session_id` + tool args; `targetUserId`/`requireMention` remain optional per-call overrides server-side):

| Env var | Required | Default | Sent as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BOT_ID` | ✅ | — | `X-Config.botId` — the bot's **public id** (`axb_…`), copy it from AgentX `/settings/bots` |
| `BOT_API_KEY` | ✅ | — | `Authorization` header — an AgentX API key (`agx_…`) from `/settings/api-keys` |
| `BOT_TARGET_USER_ID` | for bind | — | `X-Config.targetUserId` (Matrix: `@user:server`; WeChat: the bound `wx_user_id`) |
| `BOT_REQUIRE_MENTION` | no | **`true`** | `X-Config.requireMention` |
| `BOT_ORG_ID` | no | — | `X-Org-Id` header; empty = the bot's own org (Personal org for personal bots) |
| `BOT_API_URL` | no | `https://agentx.nx.run/bots.v1.BotService/McpServer` | — |
| `BOT_POLL_MS` | no | `5000` | — |

Server-side queue semantics: at most **10** pending inbound messages per
binding (overflow is rejected and the room is notified), a room member can
type **`/clear`** at any time to drop the pending queue, and each delivered
message stays re-readable for **≥3s** before it is pruned.

## What it does
- `/bot <room_name>` — create a room and bind this session (auto-unbinds + leaves a previous room). Writes `.claude/.bot-binding.json`, the shared anchor.
- `/bot unbind` — unbind and leave the room.
- `/bot status` — show current binding.
- **Outbound**: on every turn end (`Stop` hook), if bound, the `last_assistant_message` is pushed to the room. Pure shell, zero model tokens; unbound sessions make zero network calls.
- **Inbound**: `bot-channel` (local stdio MCP channel, spawned from the plugin's `.mcp.json`) polls `bot_receive` on the remote endpoint and injects new room messages into the session as `<channel source="bot-channel" ...>` events. `require_mention` filtering happens server-side. Requires the special startup flag from step 3 above.

## Architecture
```
                    ┌────────────── outbound (shell, 0 tokens) ──────────────┐
/bot cmd, Stop hook ─ curl ─► https://agentx.nx.run/bots.v1.BotService/McpServer ─► IM room
                                        ▲ bot_receive (poll)
bot-channel (stdio, .mcp.json) ─────────┘
        │ notifications/claude/channel
        ▼
Claude Code session  ── reply is just the next turn's answer ─► Stop hook pushes it back
```
Inbound and outbound share one loop: a room message arrives → Claude handles it → its final answer is pushed back by the Stop hook. No reply tool schema needed in context.
